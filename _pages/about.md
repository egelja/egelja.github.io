**Hey there!**

My name is Nikola Maruszewski (although I often go by Nino), and I am an 
undergraduate student at Northwestern University. I am majoring in Computer
Science, and plan to complete a Masters in Computer Engineering through 
a BS/MS program.

I am currently performing research on Quantum Systems with 
[Prof. Nikos Hardavellas](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hardav/) in the
[PARAG@N Lab](http://paragon.northwestern.edu/). My other interests lie in 
computer hardware, embedded systems, compilers, and operating systems.

Outside of school, I am an avid swimmer, having swam competitively for 10 years.
My other hobbies include woodworking and tinkering with embedded devices, such
as the ESP-32. I'm also involved with the [Northwestern FinTech Club](https://nuft.nikola.cx).
