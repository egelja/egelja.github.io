**Hey there!**

My name is Nikola Maruszewski (although I often go by Nino), and I am an 
student at Northwestern University. I am majoring in Computer
Science with a combined Masters in Computer Engineering, graduating in 2025. Afterwards,
I plan to persue a PhD at the intersection of Robotics and Computer Architecture. 

I am currently performing research on Computer Architecture with 
[Prof. Nikos Hardavellas](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~hardav/) in the
[PARAG@N Lab](http://paragon.northwestern.edu/). Previously, I was involved
in quantum systems research. My other interests lie in embedded systems, compilers, and operating systems.

Outside of school, I am an avid swimmer, having swam competitively for 10 years.
My other hobbies include woodworking and tinkering with embedded devices, such
as the ESP-32. I'm also involved with the [Northwestern FinTech Club](https://nuft.dev/).
